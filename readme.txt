This creates a drop-down list of all sites in a multi-site install and lets you switch to the corresponding admin page of the other site.

== Description ==

Increases productivity for Multi-Site administrators.
This is an admin site site switcher enabling you, the admin of multiple sites, to select any one of them and go directly to the equivalent page of that site.

For example, you are working on a site named “Penguin” turning on plugins, and you realize that site two (Which we will name “Linx”) has a plugin that needs to be turned on too.

Simply select “Linx” from the drop down box immediately behind the title of your site(Penguin), and it will take you to the plugin page of Linx. This lite plugin has saved myself and others hours of productive time. It’s a must have for any multi-site administrator.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.

Or use the built-in plug-in installer.
